# Ring-logger [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/nberger/ring-logger.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nberger/ring-logger)

Ring middleware to log duration and details for every request and response.

The logging backend is pluggable. Only the [clojure/tools.logging](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging) implementation is included.

Additional known backends:

* [ring-logger-onelog](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger-onelog)
* [ring-logger-timbre](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger-timbre)

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/ring-logger/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/ring-logger)


## Usage

In your `project.clj`, add the following dependency:

```clojure
    [ring-logger "0.7.7"]
```


Then, just add the middleware to your stack. It comes preconfigured with
reasonable defaults, which append ANSI colorized log messages on each
request to whatever logger is in use by [clojure/tools.logging](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging).

```clojure
    (ns foo
      (:require [ring.adapter.jetty     :as jetty]
                [ring.logger :as logger]))

    (defn my-ring-app [request]
         {:status 200
          :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
          :body "Hello world!"})

    (jetty/run-jetty (logger/wrap-with-logger my-ring-app) {:port 8080})
```

### Migration from ring.middleware.logger (or if you just want to use some OneLog goodies)

Check out [ring-logger-onelog](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger-onelog), or the
[0.6.x branch](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger/tree/0.6.x)

## Custom Logger Backend

You can supply a custom logger backend by passing an instance that reifies
the ring.logger/Logger protocol as :logger.

Example:

```clojure
(wrap-with-logger my-ring-app
  {:logger (reify ring.logger/Logger
                  (log [_ level throwable msg]
                    (case level
                      :error
                      (println "OH NOES! We have an error!"
                               msg
                               (when throwable (.getMessage throwable)))

                      :trace
                      nil ; let's ignore trace messages

                      ; else
                      (println (name level) "-" msg)))})
```

Of course this can also be done with a deftype/defrecord,
see [ring-logger-onelog](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger-onelog) and
[ring-logger-timbre](https://github.com/nberger/ring-logger-timbre) for examples.


## What Gets Logged

The default setup logs:

* an :info-level message when a request begins;
* an :info level message when a response is generated without any server
errors (i.e. its HTTP status is < 500);
* an :error level message when a response's HTTP status is >= 500;
* an :error level message with a stack trace when an exception is thrown during response generation.

All messages will be usually timestamped by your logging infrastructure.


## Custom messages and how to disable coloring

Instead of the default messages (for request start, details, exceptions, response trace) you might want to
provide your own custom messages. That's easy by supplying implementations of the printer multimethods
like `starting`, `request-details`, `exception` and others (see `ring.logger.messages` ns for more details)
and passing a `:printer` option to `wrap-with-logger`, like so:

```clojure
(defmethod request-details :my-printer
  [{:keys [logger] :as options} req]
  (trace logger (str "detailed request details: " req)
  (info logger (str "minimal request details: " (select-keys req [:character-encoding
                                                                  :content-length
                                                                  :request-method
                                                                  :uri]))))

(wrap-with-logger app {:printer :my-printer})
```

A `:no-color` printer is provided, so to disable color:

```clojure
(wrap-with-logger app {:printer :no-color})
```

## How to disable timing

Use the option `:timing false` to disable the logging of the request processing duration

```clojure
(wrap-with-logger app {:timing false})
```

## How to disable exceptions logging

This is especially useful in case of using ring.middleware.stacktrace already.

```clojure
(wrap-with-logger app {:exceptions false})
```

## Password: "[REDACTED]"

Sensitive information in params and headers can be redacted before it's sent to
the logs.

**This is very important**: Nobody wants user passwords or authentication
tokens to get to the logs and live there forever, in plain text, *right*?

By default, ring-logger will redact the authorization and cookie header, or
any param named `password` (at any nesting level). If you want ring-logger to
redact other params you can configure the `redact-keys` option:

```clojure
(wrap-with-logger app {:redact-keys #{:senha :token})
```

Ring-logger will walk through the params and headers and redact any key whose name is found in that `redact-keys` set.
If you want to use your own function to redact the keys, you can pass a `redact-fn`:

```clojure
;;log only the keys from params & headers
(wrap-with-logger app {:redact-fn (fn [m] (keys m))})
```

If you don't like `"[REDACTED]"` as the redacted value and want to use a different one, just pass the `:redact-value` option.

You can also disable query string logging in case it can contain sensitive information with `log-query-string?`
option.

## Add a request id to group all the logging related to a request

This can be accomplished by adding a ring middleware to generate a unique
request id and implementing the Logger protocol to prefix the logged messages
with that request id:

```clojure
(ns foo
  (:require [ring.logger :as logger]
            [ring.logger.protocols :as logger.protocols]
            [ring.logger.tools-logging :refer [make-tools-logging-logger]]))

(def ^:dynamic *request-id* nil)

(defn add-request-id [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (binding [*request-id* (rand-int 0xffff)]
      (handler request))))

(defn make-with-request-id-logger []
  (let [logger (make-tools-logging-logger)]
    (reify logger.protocols/Logger
      (add-extra-middleware [_ handler] handler)
      (log [_ level throwable message]
        (logger.protocols/log logger level throwable (format "(%04x) %s" *request-id* message))))))

(defroutes handler
  (GET "/" [name] (format "<h1>Hello, %s!</h1>" name)))

(def app (-> handler
             (logger/wrap-with-logger {:logger (make-with-request-id-logger)})
             add-request-id))
```

This technique is shown in the second example in [the example app](example) (which is located
in the `example` directory)

## Example Log

This is an example of logging at TRACE level with log4j:

![example log capture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nberger/ring-logger/master/example/log-capture.png)

Check out [the example project](example) if you want to generate a similar output in your local machine.

## Log the request body (for debugging)

If logging the request & response metadata is not enough when debugging and you need to take a look to
each request body, then you can use `wrap-with-body-logger`:

```clojure
(def handler (-> app
                 wrap-with-logger
                 wrap-with-body-logger))
```

__Just be careful__: This is _inefficient_ as it has to consume the body input stream from the request
and then put it again as a new input stream so your handler can also consume it as would normally do.

## Logging only certain requests

If you wish to restrict logging to certain paths (or other
conditions), combine ring-logger with
[ring.middleware.conditional](https://github.com/pjlegato/ring.middleware.conditional), like so:

```clojure
(:require [ring.middleware.conditional :as c :refer  [if-url-starts-with
                                                      if-url-doesnt-start-with
                                                      if-url-matches
                                                      if-url-doesnt-match]])

(def my-ring-app
   (-> handler
       (if-url-starts-with "/foo" wrap-with-logger)

        ;; Or:
        ;; (c/if some-test-fn wrap-with-logger)
        ;; etc.

       wrap-with-other-handler))
```

Consult the [ring.middleware.conditional docs](https://github.com/pjlegato/ring.middleware.conditional) for full details.

## Similar projects

[pjlegato/ring.middleware.logger](http://github.com/pjlegato/ring.middleware.logger): ring-logger started as a fork
of ring.middleware.logger. We recommend it as a great option if you don't mind pulling a transitive dependency on onelog & log4j.
